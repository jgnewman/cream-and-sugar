# Cream & Sugar Errors

Cream & Sugar handles errors in a friendly and familiar way, using an expression that is very similar to JavaScript's try/catch statement. There are two main differences between the CnS version and the JavaScript version:

1. Whereas JavaScript uses the keywords `try` and `catch`, CnS uses the keywords `try` and `default`. This decision was made for the purpose of keeping syntax cleaner in the future as we natively incorporate more of JavaScript's cutting-edge features.
2. CnS' try/default returns a value â€“ either from the `try` block if it was successful or from the `default` block if it was not. For example:

```coffeescript
value1 =
  try
    2 + 2
  default err
    3 + 3

value1
#=> 4

value2 =
  try
    JSON.parse '{.}'
  default err
    err

value2
#=> Error
```

The try/default expression consists of the keyword `try`, followed by an indented block of code, the keyword `default` plus an error identifier, and another indented block of code.

CnS also provides a try/default shorthand that works much like a conditional qualifier, in case you don't need to execute large blocks of code.

```coffeescript
incase JSON.parse '{.}' throws err do console.log err
```

# Cream & Sugar Overiview

Cream & Sugar (also called CnS) is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It has a couple of benefits over pure JavaScript as well as other "meta-JavaScript" dialects:

1. CnS has a beautiful, easy-to-read syntax inspired in part by CoffeeScript and Haskell, but retaining all of JavaScript's familiar data forms.
2. CnS provides [native support for JSX](./jsx.md) as part of the native syntax. And if you aren't using React, you can still use JSX syntax to generate DOM elements.
3. CnS makes it extremely simple to spin up [child processes](./processes.md) in both Node.js and the browser as well as pass messages between them.
4. CnS implements all the best parts of functionalism including immutable data, pattern matching, arity requirements, and recursion, all in a forgiving way that doesn't add too much overhead to your application's performance.

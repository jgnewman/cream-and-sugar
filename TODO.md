- stuff(err) incase stuff() throws err?
- add more pattern match techniques?
  - to consider: {a, b}, [a, b, {c, d}]
- docs
  - functions
  - iteration
  - jsx
  - Modules
  - Operations
  - try/catch (should this be revised?)
- is there a way to speed up thread generation and maybe reduce thread footprints?

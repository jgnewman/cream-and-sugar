- Add new lib functions:
  - [x] tupleToObject
  - [x] tupleToArray
  - [x] arrayToTuple
  - [x] get exports out of SYSTEM lib so we can handle lib better
  - [x] choose a way to keep code smaller by not writing lib into every file
- Fix a bug where Math.random was compiling to Math.CNS_.random
- is there a way to speed up thread generation and maybe reduce thread footprints?
